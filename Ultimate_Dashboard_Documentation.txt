DESIGN PATTERNS USED:
1. Singleton Pattern: GoogleSheetsConnector ensures single connection instance
2. Factory Pattern: Chart creation functions generate different chart types
3. Observer Pattern: Session state management for real-time updates
4. Strategy Pattern: Different formula categories for various analysis types

3. FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS
=========================

CORE FORMULA CATEGORIES:

1. BASIC SCORING & RANKING FORMULAS
Purpose: Provide fundamental scoring mechanisms to evaluate job quality
Implementation: Use mathematical operations to transform raw scores into meaningful metrics

Examples:
- Simple Score: Score
- Score Squared (Exponential scoring): Score ** 2
- Score Root (Square root scoring): Score ** 0.5
- Score Percentage: (Score / 100) * 100
- Score Categories: ((Score >= 0) & (Score < 20)) * 1 + ((Score >= 20) & (Score < 40)) * 2 + ((Score >= 40) & (Score < 60)) * 3 + (Score >= 60) * 4

2. FINANCIAL & BUDGET ANALYSIS FORMULAS
Purpose: Help evaluate the financial viability and efficiency of job opportunities
Implementation: Combine budget data with performance metrics to create value-based assessments

Examples:
- Amount per Score (Budget efficiency): Amount spent / Score
- High Budget Jobs (Premium jobs filter): Amount spent > 50000
- Value Score (Value-based scoring): Score * (Amount spent / 1000)
- Budget Efficiency: (Score / Amount spent) * 1000
- Spend per Proposal: Amount spent / Proposals
- ROI Score (Return on investment): (Score * Amount spent) / 100000

3. GEOGRAPHIC & LOCATION ANALYSIS FORMULAS
Purpose: Geographic location significantly impacts job success rates and client quality
Implementation: Use conditional logic and mapping to assign location-based scores

Examples:
- US Jobs: Country == 'United States'
- International Jobs: Country != 'United States'
- Top Countries (Major markets): Country.isin(['United States', 'UAE', 'Canada', 'UK'])
- Country Score: Country.map({'United States': 100, 'UAE': 90, 'Canada': 80, 'UK': 70}).fillna(50)
- Geographic Premium (US premium): (Country == 'United States').astype(int) * 20

4. STATISTICAL & MATHEMATICAL FORMULAS
Purpose: Statistical transformations help normalize data and identify outliers
Implementation: Apply mathematical functions to create standardized metrics

Examples:
- Z-Score (Standardized score): (Score - Score.mean()) / Score.std()
- Percentile Rank: Score.rank(pct=True) * 100
- Log Score (Logarithmic transformation): Score.apply(lambda x: __import__('math').log(x + 1) if x > 0 else 0)
- Normalized Score (Min-max normalization): (Score - Score.min()) / (Score.max() - Score.min())

5. TEXT & STRING ANALYSIS FORMULAS
Purpose: Job titles contain valuable information about job type, seniority, and requirements
Implementation: Use string methods and regular expressions to extract meaningful patterns

Examples:
- Python Jobs: Job Title.str.contains('Python', case=False)
- Senior Jobs: Job Title.str.contains('Senior|Lead|Principal', case=False)
- Remote Jobs: Job Title.str.contains('Remote|Work from home', case=False)
- Title Length: Job Title.str.len()
- Word Count: Job Title.str.split().str.len()

6. PERFORMANCE & ENGAGEMENT FORMULAS
Purpose: These metrics help evaluate job competitiveness and success probability
Implementation: Combine multiple engagement metrics to create comprehensive performance scores

Examples:
- Response Rate: (Interviewing / Proposals) * 100
- Engagement Score: Proposals + Interviewing + Invite Sent
- Activity Level: Active hires + Proposals + Interviewing
- Success Rate: (Interviewing / (Proposals + 1)) * 100
- Competition Level: Proposals / (Amount spent / 1000 + 1)

7. ADVANCED COMPOSITE SCORES
Purpose: Composite scores combine multiple factors to provide comprehensive job evaluation
Implementation: Use weighted averages and complex calculations to create multi-dimensional scores

Examples:
- ICP Score (Ideal Customer Profile): (Country == 'United States').astype(int) * 40 + (Amount spent > 20000).astype(int) * 30 + (Score > 30).astype(int) * 20 + (Proposals > 5).astype(int) * 10
- Quality Score: Score * 0.4 + (Amount spent / 1000) * 0.3 + Proposals * 0.3
- Priority Score: Score * 0.3 + (Amount spent / 1000) * 0.4 + Proposals * 0.3
- Risk Score: 100 - (Proposals * 10)
- Opportunity Score: Score * (Amount spent / 1000) * Proposals
